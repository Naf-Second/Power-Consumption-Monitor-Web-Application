# Power-Consumption-Monitor-Web-Application

This is a project I have done during the course CSE407(Green Computing).

It is a web application to monitor energy consumption of any device that is connected to Tuya Smartplug.

The app uses Tuya's api to fetch data from the tuya's server and stores it in the database.

Using the data from the database, visualizes the energy consumption.

Alternatively, you can store the fetched data in a CSV file and directly export the data into the database by linking the CSV file.
